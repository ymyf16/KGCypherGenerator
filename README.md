## B-EACON: Evolutionary Algorithm based Cypher Generator for optimal Benchmarking
### Overview
This repository aims at the following:
- Automatic random cypher query generator that is always syntactically correct, which can be used for database testing and
- EA-based benchmarking cypher query questions generation, which will be useful for standardizing the benchmarking process for AI knowledge retrieval from the general Knowledge Graph based databases.

The project is still under active development on optimizing the database connection process and the evolutionary algorithm. 

### Pre-requesites
- docker, mgconsole*(refer to original website), Pool
- example: cypher file from memgraph lab; csvs from querying the xxx, yyy from memgraph lab, forming the nested dictionary as input

### Sample Usage
- copy the cell that worked; using alzkb as example
-
